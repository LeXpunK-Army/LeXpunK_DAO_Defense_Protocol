**&lt;[DAO]/[MULTISIG]>**[^1]** JOINT DEFENSE AGREEMENT**

This &lt;[DAO]/[Multisig]> Joint Defense Agreement (this “**_Agreement_**”) is being entered into as of [&lt;DATE>] by and among the persons named [or otherwise identified] on <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Schedule 1</span> (the “**_Parties_**”). Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined on <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Exhibit A</span>. 

**BACKGROUND**



1. The Parties are, will be or have been &lt;[DAO]/[Multisig]> Participants. 
2. The Parties contemplate that some or all of the Parties could, in the future, be named as co-defendants or otherwise involved in a Legal Proceeding in connection with their past, current or future activities or status as past, current or future &lt;[DAO]/[Multisig]> Participants. 
3. The Parties anticipate that, in bringing Legal Proceedings against an Adverse Party or defending against Legal Proceedings brought by an Adverse Party, the Parties would have a mutuality of interest, and the exchange of information among them would be necessary to effective legal representation.
4. In the event of such a Legal Proceeding, the Parties wish to work together on issues of mutual interest without waiving any applicable rules of privilege or confidentiality.

**AGREEMENT**



1. **Confidentiality and Applicability of Privileges.** 

    It is the Parties’ intention and understanding that, except as required by applicable law or pursuant to an order from a court of competent jurisdiction, (a) the fact that particular communications have been made between or among the Parties; (b) the information communicated; (c) all or any part of any memoranda, documents or other materials containing or referring to such communications; and (d) the fact and existence of this Agreement, shall remain confidential and protected from disclosure to any third-party by each of the Parties’ attorney-client privilege, by the attorney work-product doctrine, by any other available privilege or protection, and by the “common interest doctrine” and/or “joint defense doctrine.” No sharing of information by and between the Parties under this Agreement shall be deemed to be a waiver of any otherwise applicable privilege or protection.

2. **Agreement to Share Information.** 

    To further their mutual interests, the Parties may share and exchange between and among themselves, as each counsel deems appropriate, communications and information (including client statements, interviews, witness statements, memoranda of law, factual summaries, transcripts and transcript digests, documents, legal strategies, legal research, drafts of pleadings, intelligence, materials prepared by consultants and/or experts and confidences) relating to Adverse Party’s claims or potential claims, the Legal Proceeding, and/or the Parties’ defenses (collectively “Joint Defense Materials”) for the limited and restricted purpose of assisting counsel in protecting the rights and interests of their respective clients. Joint Defense Materials include only those materials shared with the other Party or Parties to this Agreement or their attorneys for this purpose. Nothing in this Agreement shall require any Party to disclose materials in that Party’s files to any other Party to this Agreement, and any material not so disclosed shall not become Joint Defense Materials, but shall retain whatever privileges and protections that are available to that Party.

3. **Agreement Not to Disclose to Third Parties.** 

    The Parties agree to use reasonable efforts not to voluntarily reveal to any third-party any information received under this Agreement, except with the advance, written consent of the Party who provided such information and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. A Party receiving information under this Agreement may communicate it pursuant to an order from a court of competent jurisdiction; however, each of the Parties agrees that if it receives any summons, subpoena or similar process, or request to produce Joint Defense Materials, it will immediately notify the other Parties in writing not less than five business days’ notice before production, to permit the other Parties to take appropriate action to resist disclosure. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if five business days’ notice cannot be provided, the Party upon which the demand or request is made shall give the best notice practicable to the other Parties.

4. **Prior Exchange of Joint Defense Materials.** 

    The Parties agree that any disclosure or exchange of Joint Defense Materials made prior to the effective date of this Agreement shall be subject to all the terms and conditions of the Agreement.

5. **Right to Terminate Participation.** 

    Any Party has the right to terminate its participation in the Agreement at any time. Termination shall be effective upon tendering written notice to the other Parties. Termination of a Party’s participation under this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver or authorize a violation of this Agreement by disclosure of information and/or Joint Defense Materials obtained while a party to this Agreement. A terminating Party remains bound to maintain the confidentiality of information received under this Agreement notwithstanding its termination of participation in the Agreement. 

6. **Procedure for Adding Additional Parties. **

    &lt;_OPTION 1 - AGREEMENT IS PUBLIC + AUTOMATIC ROLLING ADMISSION OF ALL NEW PARTICIPANTS_


        Each new &lt;[DAO]/[Multisig]> Participant shall be provided with a copy of this Agreement and automatically and without further action of the other Parties be deemed a Party to this Agreement._ _Without limiting the foregoing, the existing Parties shall use reasonable efforts to obtain from each such new &lt;[DAO]/[Multisig]> Participant their signature to this Agreement and to amend <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Schedule 1</span> to reflect the admission of such &lt;[DAO]/[Multisig]> Participant as a Party to this Agreement. 


    >


    &lt;_OPTION 2 - NEW _&lt;[DAO]/[Multisig]> _PARTICIPANTS ARE ELIGIBLE TO BE ADDED AS PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT BUT DOING SO REQUIRES CONSENT OF ALL OR A MAJORITY OF CURRENT PARTIES:_


        Any &lt;[DAO]/[Multisig]> Participant may be added as an additional Party to this agreement with the prior written consent of &lt;[all]/[a majority]> of the then-current Parties. 


        &lt;_OPTION 2A (USABLE IF AGREEMENT IS PUBLIC, FOR MULTISIGS AND DAOs WITH PERMISSIONED ENTRY, IF IT IS DESIRED THAT ALL PARTICIPANTS BE PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT AND TO AVOID OFF-CHAIN SIGNATURE FORMALITIES):_


            Admission of a &lt;[DAO]/[Multisig]> Participant to the &lt;[DAO]/[Multisig]> in accordance with the &lt;[DAO]/[Multisig]>’s normal on-chain governance procedures shall automatically be deemed to constitute written consent of &lt;[all]/[a majority]> of the then-current Parties to the addition of such &lt;[DAO]/[Multisig]> Participant as a Party to this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the existing Parties shall use reasonable efforts to obtain from each such new &lt;[DAO]/[Multisig]> Participant their signature to this Agreement and to amend <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Schedule 1</span> to reflect the admission of such &lt;[DAO]/[Multisig]> Participant as a Party to this Agreement. 


	  >


        &lt;_OPTION 2B (MORE TRADITIONAL PROCESS OF ADDING PARTIES TO THE AGREEMENT–WORKS WELL IF WISHING TO KEEP AGREEMENT PRIVATE OR HAVE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT BE A SUBSET OF FULL DAO OR MULTISIG): _


            Written consent must be obtained in the form of a written or electronic signature to a joinder agreement in the form of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Exhibit B</span> from each of the requisite consenting Parties. 


            Prior to being offered to enter into, or receiving a copy of, this Agreement, each &lt;[DAO]/[Multisig]> Participant must execute and deliver a non-disclosure agreement in substantially the form of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Exhibit C</span>. 

    	  >


    >


    If the [&lt;[DAO]/[Multisig]>] constitutes a legal entity or other legal person, and binding the [&lt;[DAO]/[Multisig]>] to the terms of this Agreement is necessary or desirable in furtherance of the purposes of this Agreement, the Parties shall use reasonable efforts to cause the [&lt;[DAO]/[Multisig]>] to be added as a Party to, and bound by, this Agreement. 



7. **Notice to Sue.** 

    The Parties covenant not to sue each other for any claim, damage, loss, cause of action or liability they now have, or which may arise in the future, between themselves arising out of or related to the facts or events on which the claims made in the Legal Proceeding are based, without first providing the other Parties notice before taking such action. Providing such notice shall operate to terminate the suing Party’s participation in this Agreement pursuant to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 5</span>.

8. **Potential Conflict Waived.** 

    No Party shall assert that counsel for any other Party has a conflict of interest in the representation of their respective clients by reason of this Agreement or any Joint Defense Materials shared or obtained under the terms of this Agreement. The Parties acknowledge that they may become adverse at some point in the future. Should any Party choose to advance any type of claim against another Party, no Party shall have the benefit of relying upon (or to any adverse inference arising from) statements or communications made pursuant to this Agreement or Joint Defense Materials exchanged pursuant to this Agreement. Such statements, or use of statements, pursuant to this Agreement, or Joint Defense Materials, shall not be construed as, or argued to be, admissions or statements against the interest of any Party. 

9. **Breach of Agreement; Remedies.** 

    The Parties acknowledge that any breach of this Agreement may result in immediate and irreparable injury for which there is no adequate remedy at law and agree that specific performance and injunctive relief are appropriate remedies to compel performance of this Agreement.

10. **No Waiver of Other Privileges and Rights.** 

    Neither this Agreement nor the exchange of information or materials under its terms shall be deemed to be a waiver of any privilege or right of confidentiality as to any other information and materials. 

11. **No Limitation on Independently Created or Obtained Information. **

    Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit the right of counsel for any Party hereto to disclose to third parties materials that have been created or obtained by such counsel independent of this Agreement, whether or not those materials were shared pursuant to the Agreement, unless materials were created, in whole or in part, from any information shared pursuant to this Agreement.

12. **Miscellaneous. **

    1.  	**Mutual Nondisclosure**. “**Disclosing Party**” describes each party with respect to Confidential Information it discloses to the other party. “**Receiving Party**” describes each party with respect to Confidential Information it receives from the other party.


    2.  	**Purpose**. The parties anticipate disclosure of Confidential Information for the stated purpose (the “**Purpose**”).


    3.  	**Confidential Information**.


        (a) 	**Categories of Confidential Information**. Subject to _Section 3(b)_ (Exclusions from Confidential Information), “**Confidential Information**” means:


            (i)  	information disclosed by Disclosing Party during the term of this agreement that is related to the business of Disclosing Party;


            (ii) 	the fact that the parties are pursuing the Purpose;

        (b) 	**Exclusions from Confidential Information**.


            (i)  	**Public Information**. Information that is now public is not Confidential Information. Confidential Information that becomes public, other than as a result of breach of this agreement, ceases to be Confidential Information.


            (ii) 	**Otherwise Acquired Information**. Information that Receiving Party receives other than from Disclosing Party is not Confidential Information, unless the disclosure breached a confidentiality obligation to Disclosing Party that Disclosing Party made known to Receiving Party.


            (iii) 	**Independently Developed Information**. Information Receiving Party develops independently is not, or ceases to be, Confidential Information of Disclosing Party. Receiving Party shall bear the burden of proving independent development using contemporaneous documentary evidence.


    4.  	**Confidentiality Obligations**.


        (a) 	**Nondisclosure**. Except as described in _Section 4(b)_ (Permitted Disclosure) or as required by law, Receiving Party shall not disclose Confidential Information to anyone.


        (b) 	**Permitted Disclosure**. Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to the following personnel:


            (i)  	if Receiving Party is a legal entity, employees, independent contractors, officers, directors, and agents of Receiving Party (“**Personnel**”) who:


                (A) 	have a need to know the Confidential Information to advance the Purpose; and


                (B) 	have entered written confidentiality agreements with Receiving Party that impose confidentiality obligations affording as much or more protection as those of this agreement that apply to the Confidential Information; and


            (ii) 	legal and financial advisers providing services to Receiving Party under confidentiality obligations imposed by law or professional rules (“**Advisers**”).

## Notes

[^1]:
     The form is designed to be used either by members of a DAO or members of a multisig smart contract (e.g., a Gnosis smart contract that manages funds on behalf of or in connection with a DAO or core development team). Multisig participants should strongly consider supplementing this joint defense agreement with the [LeXpunK Multisig Participation Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1fSTEAmlcTaETFk38_ICRV9ycM0pk2L2-Kag6NRqcNRU/edit) or a similar agreement (which may establish certain legal rules and risk allocations associated with participation in the multisig, including conduct standards roughly approximating a ‘standard of care’ defined with reference to the underlying multisig purposes). 

[^2]:

     Most modern contracts have a “choice-of-law” provision such as this one, in order to gain certainty about which jurisdiction’s laws will be used to interpret, enforce and determine issues of enforceability of the contract. While such provisions are _de rigueur _in conventional commercial contracts, this agreement relates to legally novel circumstances surrounding DAOs and Multisigs. There is currently no jurisdiction in which these matters are especially legally clear, or in which abundant judicial precedent for interpreting contracts on these subjects has been built-up. Accordingly, due to these unique circumstances, it may be preferable to omit a choice-of-law provision so that there is flexibility to argue that one or more different jurisdictions’ laws applies.
    On the other hand, the parties may reason that, despite its novelty, this agreement is most likely to be enforced and properly interpreted in a jurisdiction with strong freedom-of-contract principles and which otherwise has judicial precedents enforcing conventional joint defense agreements. This line of reasoning would suggest that including a choice-of-law provision is desirable. 
    If a choice-of-law provision is included, then the selected jurisdiction should be one that has a nexus to the parties–therefore, including a choice of law provision could also be viewed as an admission by the parties that the specified jurisdiction has regulatory authority over the DAO or Multisig or DAO or Multisig Participants. This could have the effect of waiving certain jurisdictional defenses against adverse parties. 
    Consult legal counsel in light of your particular circumstances. 

[^3]:

     A “choice-of-venue” provision such as this one is also standard in most modern commercial agreements, but in the context of DAOs and Multisigs may have downsides similar to those noted above for choice-of-law provisions. Consult legal counsel in light of your particular circumstances. 

[^4]:

     Including a “no partnership” provision is desirable from the standpoint of limiting agency risks / risks of joint and several liability among the parties, but may also be used by adverse parties as evidence that a DAO is not a partnership and therefore to help adverse parties argue that voting interests in the DAO are more likely to be securities. Consult legal counsel in light of your particular circumstances. 

[^5]:
     _The bracketed language covers a protocol governance DAO. Other descriptions may be needed for different types of DAOs (e.g., a venture DAO, a guild DAO, etc.)_. 

[^6]:
     _The bracketed language covers any DAO that uses a single set of transferable, fungible, named tokens (e.g., ERC20-compatible tokens with a name & symbol) as its sole voting token for all material decisions. Other descriptions may be needed for different types of DAOs (e.g., a venture DAO, a guild DAO, etc.) or DAOs that do not make all their decisions through voting of a single type of named fungible governance token. _
